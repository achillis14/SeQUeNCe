    """Class for a simulation timeline.

    Timeline holds entities, which are configured before the simulation.
    Before the start of simulation, the timeline must initialize all controlled entities.
    The initialization of entities may schedule events.
    The timeline pushes these events to its event list.
    The timeline starts simulation by popping the top event in the event list repeatedly.
    The time of popped event becomes current simulation time of the timeline.
    The process of popped event is executed.
    The simulation stops if the timestamp on popped event is equal or larger than the stop time, or if the eventlist is empty.

    To monitor the progress of simulation, the Timeline.show_progress attribute can be modified to show/hide a progress bar.

    Attributes:
        events (EventList): the event list of timeline.
        entities (Dict[str]:Entity): the dictionary map name to the object of Entity

        run_counter (int): the counter of executed events
